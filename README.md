Double VL53L0X scanning with HAL GPIO for the STM32F446RE

To implement the VL53L0X scanning with HAL GPIO for the STM32F446RE, you would need to follow these steps:

1.  Create a new project in STM32CubeIDE, select the STM32F446RE board, and configure the clock settings and GPIO pins.
2.  Add the VL53L0X library to your project. You can download the library from the STMicroelectronics website.
3.  Configure the I2C interface for the VL53L0X sensors.
4.  Initialize the VL53L0X sensors by calling the appropriate functions from the VL53L0X library.
5.  Set up a timer to trigger the scanning process at a regular interval.
6.  In the timer interrupt handler, trigger the VL53L0X scanning process and read the distance values from the sensors.
7.  Process the distance data and use the GPIO pins to control any connected peripherals, such as LEDs or motors.
